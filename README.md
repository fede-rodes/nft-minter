# Getting Started

You'll probably need node version 16 or higher installed on your machine.

1. After cloning the repo `yarn install`
2. CD into `client` and create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file from `.env.example` filling all required information. You can use the defaults when runnning locally.
3. From the root, build contracts: `yarn run build:server`.
4. Run locally both server and client by running `yarn run dev` from the root directory.
5. Import one of the 20 test account generated by Hardhat into your Metamask.

## Stuff

There exist several standards of smart contracts that have been developed for NFTs.
The most famous ones are the ERC721 and the ERC1155.

The main big difference between the two is that in an ERC721, every NFT is unique which means you will have to reference the content for each of them.

Meanwhile the ERC1155 enables you to create “collections” which are several copies of the same NFT.

The ERC721, which is easier to use, still can be used to upload several copies of the same content, but is less optimised for this use case than the ERC1155.
