# Getting Started

You'll probably need node version 16 or higher installed on your machine.

1. After cloning the repo `yarn install`
2. CD into `client` and create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file from `.env.example` filling all required information. You can use the defaults when runnning locally.
3. From the root, build contracts: `yarn run build:server`.
4. Run locally both server and client by running `yarn run dev` from the root directory.
5. Import one of the 20 test account generated by Hardhat into your Metamask.
