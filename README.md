# Getting Started

1. After cloning the repo `yarn install`
2. CD into `client` and create a `.env` file from `.env.example` filling all required information.
3. From the root, build contracts: `yarn run build:server`.
4. Run locally both server and client by running `yarn run dev` from the root directory.
5. Import one of the 20 test account generated by Hardhat into your Metamask.
